## The Fine Print

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to `nancy` support in regard to this project
* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:

## Getting help
