## The Fine Print

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours
to the open source community (read: you!)

Remember:

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to `nancy` support in regard to this project
* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:

## Getting help

Looking to contribute to our code but need some help? There's a few ways to get information:

* Create Issues in this github project.
* See the `community: CircleCI Discuss` badge at the top of this page.
